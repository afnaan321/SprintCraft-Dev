        <p>SprintCraft aims to develop intelligent software that automates user story generation from Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents. By accepting an SRS and a user prompt as inputs, the tool will generate accurate, contextually aligned user stories. It will also feature self-evaluation mechanisms, customization via prompts, and a history-tracking system for consistent results. The scope includes a user-friendly interface and a backend powered by fine-tuned LLMs.</p>
